# Email-Extraction-Validation
This script can handle files with millions of lines. If you have an extremely large dataset, consider running it on a machine with sufficient CPU power. Let me know if you'd like me to assist further!

# Key Features
Email Extraction & Validation:

Utilizes a regex pattern to extract and validate emails.
Supports Unicode characters for internationalized email addresses.
MX Record Validation:

Caches results of DNS queries to minimize redundant lookups.
Ensures that the email domain has valid MX records.
Categorization:

Categorizes emails into predefined categories like Gmail, Yahoo, Microsoft, AOL, or others based on the domain.
Duplicate Handling:

Tracks processed emails to avoid duplicates across multiple files.
Dynamic File Saving:

Saves valid emails to category-based files with timestamps.
Concurrent Processing:

Uses ThreadPoolExecutor to process lines concurrently, optimizing performance for large files.
Encoding Flexibility:

Tries multiple encodings (utf-8, latin-1, ISO-8859-1) to read the input file, ensuring compatibility with various file formats.
Progress Monitoring:

Provides a real-time progress bar using tqdm to keep track of file processing.
Usage
Run the script and input the path to the file containing email data.
The script processes the file, categorizes and validates emails, and saves them in corresponding category files.
Potential Enhancements
Error Handling:

Improve logging for DNS-related errors.
Graceful handling of network-related issues during MX record checks.
Performance Improvements:

Fine-tune the number of threads in ThreadPoolExecutor for optimal performance.
Use bulk DNS queries if supported by the resolver library.
# Customization:

Allow customization of categories via configuration files or command-line arguments.
Important Notes
Ensure the dnspython library is installed (pip install dnspython) as it is required for MX record validation.
The script may not work correctly for domains with unusual DNS configurations or unsupported email patterns. Always test with real-world data to ensure reliability.
